---Program flow (if, while, etc.)---
label some_label
goto some_label
if-goto some_label (pop the stack top value, if true goto label)

---Function calling---
(class Foo, function bar -> Foo.bar function name on VM level)
function Foo.bar n -> here start the function code with n local variables
call Foo.bar m -> call function, m is the amount of arguments pushed on the top of the stack
return -> return to the calling function

1)Before calling the function, the
caller must push as many arguments
as necessary onto the stack;
2)Next, the caller invokes the
function using the call command;
3) After the called function returns,
the arguments that the caller has
pushed before the call have
disappeared from the stack, and a
return value (that always exists)
appears at the top of the stack;
4) After the called function returns,
the callerâ€™s memory segments
argument, local, static, this,
that, and pointer are the same as
before the call, and the temp segment
is undefined.


all methods should have argument 0 = this, type of this is the class name
